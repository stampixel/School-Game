            text "Teddy’s uncle in The Fall of a City is portrayed as both dismissive and condescending, which ultimately diminishes Teddy’s sense of imagination and self-worth. Notably, the uncle's dismissive nature occurs when he mocks Teddy’s imaginative play, “‘You’d never guess what the kid has been doing up there!’ He shook his head in wonder and amusement. ‘You’d never believe it, but that great big lummox has been playing with paper dolls’” (Nolan 4). Teddy’s uncle ridicules Teddy, himself, and his creative play with paper figures, referring to him disparagingly as a “great big lummox” and mocking his interest as childish and insignificant (4). The uncle’s laughter and disbelief further underscores his dismissive view of Teddy’s imagination and efforts as the great King Theodore has been reduced to simply being a paper doll. Moreover, the uncle's condescending attitude is evident, “His uncle pointing a warning finger. ‘Don’t get saucy now, mister. I know paper dolls when I see ‘em.’ Once again he burst into laughter. His cheeks were the colour of a tomato” (4).Teddy’s uncle is condescending when he uses patronizing language like “mister” and “saucy”, dismissing Teddy’s interests with a belittling comment about “paper dolls,” and mocking Teddy’s creativity with laughter, thereby showing a lack of respect and understanding (4). Overall, the uncle’s dismissive and condescending behaviors work together to stifle Teddy’s imaginative spirit and reinforce rigid expectations of maturity and conformity." size 36
