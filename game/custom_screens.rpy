            text "Teddy’s uncle in The Fall of a City is portrayed as both dismissive and condescending, which ultimately diminishes Teddy’s sense of imagination and self-worth. One clear example of the uncle's dismissive nature occurs when he mocks Teddy’s imaginative play, stating, “Only fools and cowards build forts out of paper boxes” (Nowlan). By belittling Teddy’s creation, the uncle invalidates Teddy’s imaginative world, discouraging his creative expression. Moreover, the uncle's condescending attitude is evident when he says, “You're too old for such nonsense,” implying that Teddy should outgrow his creative pursuits. This remark not only undermines Teddy’s imagination but also implies that creativity is childish and unworthy of respect. In the end, the uncle’s dismissive and condescending behaviors work together to stifle Teddy’s imaginative spirit and reinforce rigid expectations of maturity and conformity." size 40
